# Deep-Learning
Multilayer Perceptron using NumPy

This project is implemenetating of a Deep Neural Network without using any machine learning library. It involves defining custom activations, loss criterion and also implements Batch Normalization. The neural network is self sufficient and implements backpropagation using only NumPy libraries.


Contains the following files:

1) Activation.py: General activation structure
2) Criterion.py: General Loss function
3) BatchNorm.py: Class for implemention Batch Normalization
4) MLP.py: The MLP Class Object
5) trainingstats.py: Getting the stats for your object
